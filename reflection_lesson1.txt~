Reflection and Learning

People learn from experience, but deep learning comes from reflection.
People set up expectation based on experience, 
Act on the reality to get new experience, either this enhances their original understanding or corrects it
People reflect on this process and gain deeper understanding through reflection again.

Reflection theory roots from brain antonomy
Concrete experience
Reflective observation
Abstract hypotheses
Active testing

Reflection is a search for connections.

It's hard to make meaning out of experience unless it engages emotion.

Storytelling makes it easier to learn.
