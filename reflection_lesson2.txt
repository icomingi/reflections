What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Create .git file keep track of the snapshots of the files in the directory, with no commits at first.
To tell git I want to track the version histories of this directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is like a pointer in the world of all directories on the computer, to indicate current working directory.
Respository is a place where commits of files are tracked, organized, and stored.
Staging area is not a directory, something like a place prepared before commits
It's a cushion area, select what changes one would like to commit, option to revert back
